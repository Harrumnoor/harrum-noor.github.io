        <!-- About Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Master’s student at the University of Waterloo, supervised by Dr. M. Tamer Özsu. I am part of the Data Systems Group, one of North America’s premier research collectives in data systems. My research focuses on enhancing human-database interactions using Large Language Models, with a current emphasis on NL2SQL systems. Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing video games (currently immersed in *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom*), painting on glass (I’ve built a collection of stained glass pieces, all hand-painted), and traveling. A fun fact about me: I once traveled across three continents in just three days!</p>
